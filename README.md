# LannzAI - Personal AI Chatbot

This is a full-stack AI chatbot application featuring a React/Vite/TypeScript frontend and a Python/Flask backend powered by a local Ollama model.

## Features

- Interactive and responsive chat interface.
- Real-time AI responses generated by a local LLM (Llama 3).
- Typing indicators and smooth scrolling for a great user experience.
- AI is personalized with a custom knowledge base (`my_facts.txt`).

## üöÄ How It Works

This application operates on a full-stack architecture, allowing the frontend to communicate with a dedicated backend server that orchestrates AI interactions.

-   **Frontend (Client-Side)**:
    -   Developed with **React**, **Vite**, and **TypeScript** for a blazing-fast development experience and robust code.
    -   Styled using **Tailwind CSS** for a utility-first approach to design.
    -   Manages the chat history, user input, and displays messages with real-time UI updates 
    -   Communicates with the backend API to send user messages and receive AI responses.

-   **Backend (Server-Side)**:
    -   Built with **Python** and **Flask**, providing a lightweight and efficient API endpoint.
    -   Acts as an intermediary, receiving user queries from the frontend.
    -   Forwards these queries to the local AI model (Ollama) along with a custom "system prompt" and your personal facts.
    -   Processes the AI's response and sends it back to the frontend.

-   **AI Core (Local LLM)**:
    -   Powered by **Ollama**, which enables running large language models like **Llama 3** directly on your computer.
    -   This ensures privacy, speed, and completely free AI inference after the initial model download.
    -   The AI model uses the provided `my_facts.txt` as its context to generate relevant and personalized answers.
